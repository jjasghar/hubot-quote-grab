# hubot-quote-grab

Sometimes you want to grab good quotes from your channels, and randomly call them back

So I totally stole [overheard.coffee](overheard.coffee) which does 80% of what I want. I may update it over time.

### Commands

```
   hubot <user> said "<some quote>" (<context>)
   hubot quote me - show random quote
   hubot quotes - show all quotes
   hubot quotes clear - delete all quotes in the system
```
