# hubot-quote-grab

Sometimes you want to grab good quotes from your channels, and randomly call them back

tl;dr I want to re-create [QuoteGrabs](http://ubottu.com/supydocs/plugins/QuoteGrabs.html) in coffeescript for hubot.

# Initial design steps to make this
~~1. get hubot to store to redis brain on a specific non-traditional production redis db~~
~~2. get hubot to pull from redis brain~~
3. get hubot to randomly pull a key from redis brain
4. add other commands to clear/remove other things from the redis db
5. add functionality to write out/export to a log file (if wanted)
